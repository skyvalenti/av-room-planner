# 3D AV Room Planner
Interactive 3D room planner with AV equipment visualization capabilities using React and Three.js, a popular library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. This tool allows PMs to visualize AV equipment placement in a 3D space.

# AV Room Planner

A 3D visualization tool for AV Technical Program Managers to plan and showcase audio-visual setups in various room configurations.

## Features & Potential Usage

Here's a breakdown of its features and potential uses:

3D Visualization: The tool uses Three.js (via React Three Fiber) to create a 3D representation of a room. This allows the PM to visualize the space and equipment placement from any angle.
Interactive Controls: Users can orbit around the room using mouse controls, giving them a comprehensive view of the space.
AV Equipment Representation: The tool includes basic 3D models of AV equipment (represented as colored boxes with labels in this simple version). In a more advanced version, these could be replaced with detailed 3D models of actual AV equipment.
Room Resizing: The buttons allow users to adjust the room dimensions, which could be useful for planning different spaces or comparing equipment layouts in rooms of varying sizes.
Scalability: While this version is basic, it could be expanded to include features like:

Drag-and-drop placement of equipment
A library of different AV equipment models
Ability to save and load different room configurations
Calculation of optimal speaker placement based on room acoustics
Integration with other systems to pull in real equipment specifications

This tool could be invaluable for PMs in several ways:

Planning: Visualize different equipment setups before physical installation.
Collaboration: Use the 3D model to communicate ideas clearly with team members and stakeholders.
Training: Use it as a visual aid when training new team members on AV setup principles.
Client Presentations: Demonstrate proposed AV solutions in a tangible, interactive way.

To use this component, you would need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei) and that you're using a build system that can handle these libraries (Create React App should work out of the box).
This tool represents an innovative approach to AV planning, bringing 3D visualization capabilities typically found in specialized CAD software into a web-based, React environment. It's less common than standard dashboards or project management tools, making it a unique asset.
